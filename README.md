# Front-End-Devs-Practice

This repo is my personal space to practice and improve my front-end development skills.
I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building small projects and solving real-world problems.

## ðŸ“˜ What Iâ€™m Practicing:
HTML structure and semantic tags
CSS styling, Flexbox, and Grid layout
Responsive design techniques
JavaScript DOM manipulation
UI interactions and components
Clean and readable code writing

##ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo?
I learn best by doing. So Iâ€™m building things as I go â€” breaking stuff, fixing it, and learning along the way. This repo tracks my growth and helps me stay consistent.

##ðŸš€ Learning in Progressâ€¦
Iâ€™ll keep updating this repo with more projects and exercises as I learn new things.
